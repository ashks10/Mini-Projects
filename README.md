# 🚀 Java Mini Projects – 100 Days to SDE 🔥

This repository contains all the **Java CLI-based mini projects** I'm building as part of my **100-day self-driven journey** to master backend development and crack high-impact software developer roles (₹15–20 LPA target).

## 📌 Objectives

- Reinforce core Java concepts through practical implementation
- Practice OOP principles (abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, encapsulation)
- Simulate real-world system behaviors in a CLI environment
- Build a project-based foundation before transitioning to full-stack backend (Spring Boot)

- **Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub (Daily commits)
- **Build Tools** (Upcoming): Gradle / Maven

> > Grinding 12–14 hrs/day to build mastery.  
> > ✅ Daily commits  
> > ✅ LeetCode + DSA alongside  
> > 🎯 Goal: ₹15–20 LPA by Day 100
